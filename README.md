## 📈 Key Insights & Findings
- _[**Explosive Growth**](https://github.com/Sahu-Ashwani/Sales-and-finance-analysis/blob/main/Yearly%20Finanace%20report.pdf)_: Net sales surged from **87.5M in 2019 to 598.9M** in 2021, representing a remarkable **204% year-over-year growth** in 2021. This dramatic expansion indicates strong market positioning and successful scaling strategies across all business divisions.

- _[**Market Gaps**](https://github.com/Sahu-Ashwani/Sales-and-finance-analysis/blob/main/Market%20Performance%20Report.pdf)_: While overall growth is strong, most markets are falling **5-15% short of revenue targets**, with some like **Poland (-15.35%) and Canada (-12.63%)** showing significant gaps. This signals need for targeted market strategy adjustments and resource reallocation to bridge performance gaps.  

- _[**Innovation Impact**](https://github.com/Sahu-Ashwani/Sales-and-finance-analysis/blob/main/New%20Product%20Report.pdf)_: New product launches generated **176.2M** in revenue, proving the effectiveness of **innovation-driven market expansion**.

The challenge lies in maintaining **profitability while scaling volume**, particularly as subzone margins vary significantly from **32% (India) to 38-44% (other regions)**.
