## 📈 Key Insights & Findings
- **Explosive Growth**: Net sales surged from **87.5M in 2019 to 598.9M** in 2021, representing a remarkable **204% year-over-year growth** in 2021. This dramatic expansion indicates strong market positioning and successful scaling strategies across all business divisions.

- **Market Gaps**: While overall growth is strong, most markets are falling **5-15% short of revenue targets**, with some like **Poland (-15.35%) and Canada (-12.63%)** showing significant gaps. This signals need for targeted market strategy adjustments and resource reallocation to bridge performance gaps.  

- **Innovation Impact**: New product launches generated **176.2M** in revenue, proving the effectiveness of **innovation-driven market expansion**.  

- **Margin Pressure**: While gross margins remained stable around **36-42%**, there's a concerning downward trend from **41.4% (2019) to 36.4% (2021)**. The challenge lies in maintaining **profitability while scaling volume**, particularly as subzone margins vary significantly from **32% (India) to 38-44% (other regions)**.

- **Geographic Insights**: India dominates with **161.3M** in revenue but operates at **lower margins (32-33%)**, while smaller markets like ANZ show declining margins from **42.6% to 38.3%**. This geographic analysis reveals opportunities for margin optimization and market-specific strategies.
